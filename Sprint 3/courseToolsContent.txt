//FireFox

Mozilla Firefox is a free and open source web browser developed for Windows, OS X and Linux,
with a mobile version for Android, by Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla 
Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements 
current and anticipated web standards.

//FireFox Standards

Firefox implements many web standards, including HTML4 (partial HTML5), XML, XHTML, MathML,
SVG 1.1 (partial), CSS (with extensions), ECMAScript (JavaScript), DOM, XSLT, XPath, 
and APNG (Animated PNG) images with alpha transparency. Firefox also implements standards 
proposals created by the WHATWG such as client-side storage, and canvas element
Firefox has passed the Acid2 standards-compliance test since version 3.0. Mozilla had 
originally stated that they did not intend for Firefox to pass the Acid3 test fully because
they believed that the SVG fonts part of the test had become outdated and irrelevant, due 
to WOFF being agreed upon as a standard by all major browser makers. Because the SVG 
font tests were removed from the Acid3 test in September 2011, Firefox 4 and greater scored 100/100.
Firefox also implements a proprietary protocol from Google called "Safe Browsing", 
used to exchange data related with phishing and malware protection.

//Firebug

Firebug integrates with Firefox to put a wealth of web development tools at your fingertips 
while you browse. You can edit, debug, and monitor CSS, HTML, and JavaScript live in any web 
page.Firebug makes it simple to find HTML elements buried deep in the page. Once you've found 
what you're looking for, Firebug gives you a wealth of information, and lets you edit the HTML 
live.Firebug's CSS tabs tell you everything you need to know about the styles in your web pages, 
and if you don't like what it's telling you, you can make changes and see them take effect instantly.
Firebug includes a powerful JavaScript debugger that lets you pause execution at any time and have look
at the state of the world. If your code is a little sluggish, use the JavaScript profiler to measure 
performance and find bottlenecks fast.


//Notepad ++

Notepad++ is a text editor and source code editor for Windows. It aims to be a lightweight 
and robust editor for a variety of programming and scripting languages. One advantage of Notepad++ 
over the built-in Windows text editor Notepad, is that Notepad++ supports tabbed editing, which 
allows working with multiple open files. Notepad++ opens big files significantly faster and can 
be used as Windows Notepad replacement.
Notepad++ supports syntax highlighting and code folding for over 50 programming, scripting, 
and markup languages. It attempts to automatically detect the language that a given file uses,
using a modifiable list of file extension bindings. Users may also manually set the current language, 
overriding the extension's default language. The program also supports autocompletion for a subset of 
the API of some programming languages

//Filezilla
FileZilla is free and cross-platform FTP software, consisting of FileZilla Client and FileZilla Server. 
Binaries are available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. It supports FTP, SFTP, and FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS).
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another 
host over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet.

//Git
Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed. 
Git has been adopted by many projects. Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository
with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.
Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.

//GitHub
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. 
GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for open source projects. The site provides
social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and the network graph to display how developers work on their 
versions of a repository.

//gimp

GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching,
image composition and image authoring.It has many capabilities. GIMP has tools used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, 
resizing, cropping, photo-montages, converting between different image formats, and more specialised tasks. Animated 
images such as GIF and MPEG files can be created using an animation plugin.

//chrome

Google Chrome is a free, open-source web browser developed by Google. It was released in 2008, and has grown to be one 
of the most popular browsers today. When Google decided to make a browser, they wanted to completely rethink the browser, 
as browsing now is very different from browsing simple text pages. Now we email, shop, pay bills, and run large application 
in our browsers. Chrome has really excellent support for HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

//chrome developer tools

The DevTools, bundled in Chrome, provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application.
Web development tools include a panel to debug scripts by allowing developers to add watch expressions, breakpoints, 
view the call stack, and pause, step over, step into, and step out of functions while debugging JavaScript.
A JavaScript console is included. The consoles allow developers to type in JavaScript commands and call functions,
or view errors that may have been encountered during the execution of a script. HTML viewer and editor is included in the 
built in web development tools. The difference between the HTML viewer, and the view source feature in web browsers is that the HTML 
viewer allow you to see the HTML as it was rendered in addition to allowing you to make changes to the HTML and see the change 
reflected in the page after the change is made.
In addition to selecting and editing, the HTML elements panels will usually also display properties of the HTML object, 
such as display dimension, and CSS properties.

//safari

Safari is a web browser developed by Apple Inc. and included with the Mac OS X and iOS operating systems.
Apple has adopted and has taken an active role in defining standards, such as HTML5 and CSS3, that ensure 
consistency and push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web. Advancements in web standards mean that 
leading-edge Internet experiences — rich media and interactive graphics, for example — are available to everyone.
Safari was the first browser to support HTML5 audio and video tags. They allow developers to integrate media directly
into standard web pages. Full-screen and closed-caption support for HTML5 video lets developers deliver a richer and
more accessible video experience. With geolocation support, websites can customize content for users who choose to 
share their location. Web notifications in Safari are a way to keep users informed about anything related to a 
developer’s website — an update, a message, or any interactive element. And by supporting HTML5 offline technologies,
Safari allows web-based applications to store information on your hard drive, so you can use them even without an 
Internet connection.
Safari was also the first browser to support CSS3 Animations, which bring a new level of interactivity to the web, 
and CSS Effects, which let developers add polish to websites by stylizing images and photos with eye-catching gradients, 
precise masks, and stunning reflections. CSS Filters now enable advanced effects and animations that tap into hardware 
acceleration for fast, smooth rendering
